# Artificial Intelligence in Computational Chemistry and Materials Science  
## Sample Exercises Repository 

This private repository contains **representative sample exercises** prepared in support of the proposed course:

**Course 1: Artificial Intelligence in Computational Chemistry and Materials Science**  
**Duration:** 14 weeks  
**Level:** Adaptable (Undergraduate / Postgraduate / Doctoral)

The notebooks provided here are **illustrative examples only**, intended to give the curriculum committee an overview of the **scope, depth, and computational flavor** of the proposed course.  
The complete course materials will be **revised and expanded** based on academic background, program requirements, and committee feedback.

## Objective

The proposed course introduces **machine learning and artificial intelligence methods tailored for chemistry and materials science applications**. Students Will learn regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, and interpretable AI techniques, and apply them to **molecular property prediction, materials data analysis, and scientific decision-making**.

A key objective is to enable students to **build end-to-end ML pipelines** for real-world scientific datasets while emphasizing **domain knowledge, interpretability, and uncertainty awareness**.

## Repository Scope

This repository contains a **subset of instructional notebooks** demonstrating:

- Core machine learning workflows  
- Molecular and materials representations  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning methods  
- Model interpretability and analysis  

These exercises are **not exhaustive** and do not represent the final course deliverables.

---
## Tools and Execution

The notebooks are designed to run using:

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- PyTorch  
- RDKit  
- DScribe  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  

No proprietary software is required.
